"""
Develop a game of Bulls and Cows. The program chooses
a four-digit number, and the player has to guess it. After
the user enters a number, the program reports how many digits of
the number are guessed (bulls), and how many digits are guessed
and stand in the right place (cows). After guessing the number,
print the number of userâ€™s attempts. Use recursion in your game.
